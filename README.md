The function scripts are based on SS_Scenario_1. 
Deep function: Produces the depth (z) at deep waters plus the depth produced from the storm surges (SS).
At the breakwater: Produced the depth (z) at the structure while also assessing for wave breaking and refraction processes.
Behind the breakwater: Produce the depth (z) as an average value from underwater profiles while also assessing for wave breaking and diffraction processes.
